# DBMS-Netflix

## Project Selection: 
Our project, titled "DataFlix," was selected based on its relevance to the current industry trends and the team's collective interest in exploring the dynamics of data management for streaming services. Considerations included the potential for gaining insights into user behavior, optimizing streaming performance, and enhancing overall user satisfaction.
Data Acquisition: We fabricated dataset that simulated user interaction analytics within a streaming service application. This dataset was structured to closely mimic the patterns and events observed in popular streaming platforms like Netflix or Hulu.

## Data Sampling: 
A subset of the raw data included details of video playback events, user subscriptions, recommendations, and content-related information. Session IDs, timestamps, subscription lifecycles, and algorithmic content suggestions were integral components of the dataset.


## Data Cleaning (ETL): 
The data cleaning process involved Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) operations to ensure the data's quality and integrity. The team addressed challenges such as inconsistencies in timestamps, missing values, and discrepancies in content-related information in Python, and some minor modifications were done in PowerBI.


## Research Questions: 
The group aimed to answer questions related to errors while watching the video, analyzing subscriber trends, measuring streaming metrics, and optimizing data architecture. These questions were designed to provide actionable insights for enhancing the streaming service's performance and user experience.


## Tools and Technology:
The project leveraged Azure for data storage, Power BI for dashboarding, and Azure Cosmos for NoSQL database management. The combination of these tools offered a cost-effective, high-performance, and scalable solution for handling the streaming service's data.


## Real-Life Impact: 
The project's outcomes hold significant real-life implications for the streaming service industry, offering insights applicable to maximize user engagement, optimize content recommendations, and enhance overall streaming service performance. The implemented database strategy and data pipeline design address challenges in managing large-scale user interaction data, providing practical applications for streaming platforms. The integration of a real-time monitoring and response mechanism, driven by analytics, facilitates prompt issue resolution, capitalizes on emerging trends, and allows for near real-time adaptation of content strategy, ensuring a competitive edge in the dynamic streaming landscape. The DataFlix project, with these insights, adopts a comprehensive and forward-looking approach to data management in streaming services. Prioritizing user privacy and data security, maintaining a continuous improvement loop, and embracing adaptability to emerging technologies contribute to the project's long-term impact and relevance in the evolving streaming industry. Collaboration with content creators further enriches content recommendations, fostering a personalized and diverse content library.
